            as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data
            protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data

            bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the
            data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become
            insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data
            importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited
